CHANGELOG
=========

3.4.0 (2024-04-16)
------------------

* Added `PXP_FINANCIAL` and `TRUSTPAY` to the `Payment.Processor` enum.
* Equivalent domain names are now normalized when `hashAddress` is used.
  For example, `googlemail.com` will become `gmail.com`.
* Periods are now removed from `gmail.com` email address local parts when
  `hashAddress` is used. For example, `f.o.o@gmail.com` will become
  `foo@gmail.com`.
* Fastmail alias subdomain email addresses are now normalized when
  `hashAddress` is used. For example, `alias@user.fastmail.com` will become
  `user@fastmail.com`.
* Additional `yahoo.com` email addresses now have aliases removed from
  their local part when `hashAddress` is used. For example,
  `foo-bar@yahoo.com` will become `foo@yahoo.com` for additional
  `yahoo.com` domains.
* Duplicate `.com`s are now removed from email domain names when
  `hashAddress` is used. For example, `example.com.com` will become
  `example.com`.
* Certain TLD typos are now normalized when `hashAddress` is used. For
  example, `example.comcom` will become `example.com`.
* Additional `gmail.com` domain names with leading digits are now
  normalized when `hashAddress` is used. For example, `100gmail.com` will
  become `gmail.com`.
* Additional `gmail.com` typos are now normalized when `hashAddress` is
  used. For example, `gmali.com` will become `gmail.com`.
* When `hashAddress` is used, all trailing periods are now removed from an
  email address domain. Previously only a single period was removed.
* When `hashAddress` is used, the local part of an email address is now
  normalized to NFC.

3.3.0 (2023-12-05)
------------------

* Updated `geoip2` dependency to version that includes the `isAnycast` method
  on `com.maxmind.geoip2.record.Traits`. This returns `true` if the IP
  address belongs to an [anycast network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anycast).
  This is available in minFraud Insights and Factors.

3.2.0 (2023-10-27)
------------------

* Updated `geoip2` to 4.1.0 to prevent exception when deserializing the
  new `Satellite` value to the `ConnectionType` enum. Pull request by
  Neal Zhu. GitHub #278.
* Jackson was updated to 2.15.2.

3.1.0 (2023-03-02)
------------------

* `com.maxmind.geoip2` is now a transitive dependency of this Java module.
* Added `PLACETOPAY` to the `Payment.Processor` enum.

3.0.0 (2022-12-12)
------------------

* This library is now a Java module.
* Removed deprecated `last4Digits` method on `CreditCard.Builder` and
  `getLast4Digits` method on `CreditCard`. Use `lastDigits` and
  `getLastDigits` instead.
* Removed deprecated `connectTimeout(int)`, `readTimeout(int)`, and
  `proxy(Proxy)` on `WebServiceClient.Builder`. Use
  `connectTimeout(Duration)`, `requestTimeout(Duration)`, and
  `proxy(ProxySelector)` instead.
* `WebServiceClient` no longer implements `Closeable` and the `Close`
  method has been removed. This method was deprecated when the library
  switched to using `java.net.http.HttpClient`.

2.2.0 (2022-10-31)
------------------

* Added `GOOGLE_PAY` and `SHOPIFY_PAYMENTS` to the `Payment.Processor` enum.
* Updated Jackson and GeoIP2 dependencies.

2.1.0 (2022-03-28)
------------------

* Added the input `/credit_card/country`. This is the country where the
  issuer of the card is located. This may be passed instead of the
  `/credit_card/issuer_id_number` if you do not wish to pass partial
  account numbers or if your payment processor does not provide them. You
  may provide this using the `country` method on `CreditCard.Builder`.

2.0.0 (2022-01-24)
------------------

* Java 11 or greater is now required.
* Apache HttpClient has been replaced with `java.net.http.HttpClient`.
* The `close()` method on `WebServiceClient` is now deprecated. It
  no longer does anything.
* On `WebServiceClient.Builder`:
  * `connectTimeout(int)` has been deprecated in favor of
    `connectTimeout(Duration)`.
  * `readTimeout(int)` has been deprecated in favor of
    `requestTimeout(Duration)`.
  * `proxy(Proxy)` has been deprecated in favor of `proxy(ProxySelector)`.
* On `HttpException` and `InvalidRequestException`, `getUrl()` has been
  deprecated in favor of `getUri()`. Constructors that took a `URL` have
  been replaced with the equivalent taking a `URI`.
* Deprecated constructors on model classes were removed.
* Removed deprecated response methods:
  * `Email.getAddressMd5()`
  * `Subscores.getEmailTenure()`
  * `Subscores.getIpTenure()`
* Removed `GeoIp2Country` and its associated `isHighRisk()` method.
  `IpAddress.getCountry()` now returns a `com.maxmind.geoip2.record.Country`.
* Removed deprecated `Payment.Processor.VERAPAY` enum value. Use `VEREPAY`
  instead.
* `Email.getDomain()` will now return an empty object rather than null if
  there is no domain data. This is match other response model class getters.
* Upgraded the `geoip2` dependency to 2.16.1. This adds mobile country code
  (MCC) and mobile network code (MNC) to minFraud Insights and Factors
  responses. These are available at
  `response.getIpAddress.getTraits.getMobileCountryCode()` and
  `response.getIpAddress.getTraits.getMobileNetworkCode()`. We expect this
  data to be available by late January 2022.
* The following payment processors were added to the `Payment.Processor` enum:
  * `BOACOMPRA`
  * `BOKU`
  * `COREGATEWAY`
  * `FISERV`
  * `NEOPAY`
  * `NEOSURF`
  * `OPENBUCKS`

  * `TRUSTLY`
  * `WINDCAVE`
* `com.maxmind.minfraud.request.CreditCard.last4Digits` has been deprecated in
  favor of `lastDigits` and will be removed in a future release. `lastDigits`
  / `last4Digits` also now supports two digit values in addition to the
  previous four digit values.
* Eight digit `com.maxmind.minfraud.request.CreditCard.issuerIdNumber` inputs are
  now supported in addition to the previously accepted six digit `issuerIdNumber`.
  In most cases, you should send the last four digits for
  `com.maxmind.minfraud.request.CreditCard.last4Digits`. If you send a
  `issuerIdNumber` that contains an eight digit IIN, and if the credit card brand
  is not one of the following, you should send the last two digits for
  `lastDigits`:
  * `Discover`
  * `JCB`
  * `Mastercard`
  * `UnionPay`
  * `Visa`
* Apache Commons Codec is no longer used for generating MD5s.

  Factors. This is available at `response.getDisposition().getRuleLabel()`, and
  is the label of the custom rule that was triggered by the transaction.
* Added support for the `/credit_card/was_3d_secure_successful` input in Score,
  Insights and Factors. This input should indicate whether or not the outcome of
  3D-Secure verification (e.g. Safekey, SecureCode, Verified by Visa) was
  successful. `true` if customer verification was successful, or `false` if the
  customer failed verification. If 3-D Secure verification was not used, was
  unavailable, or resulted in another outcome other than success or failure, do
  not include this field. Use the `was3dSecureSuccessful(Boolean)` method on
  `com.maxmind.minfraud.request.CreditCard.Builder` to set it.

  `/subscores/shipping_address` (the risk associated with the shipping
  address).

1.14.0 (2020-06-10)
-------------------

  than its MD5 hash. Previously only the MD5 hash of the email address
  would be sent, and sending the plain text email address was not possible.
  If you wish to send only the MD5 hash of the email address, you must now
  call `hashAddress()` on the `Email` builder in addition to `address()`.
